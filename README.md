Overview

TetrAI Nav leverages AI to analyze complex aviation navigation challenges and provides human operators with actionable suggestions. Our solution integrates a hybrid decision-making model:

AI Determines: AI processes data and identifies optimal navigation solutions.

AI Suggests: AI presents its suggestions in an understandable and actionable format.

Human Decides: The final decision rests with human operators to ensure accountability and safety.

This project showcases how AI can complement human expertise, fostering trust and collaboration in critical operations like air traffic control.

Features

Hybrid Decision Model: Blends AI's computational power with human judgment.

Real-Time Navigation Suggestions: AI processes data to suggest optimal flight paths.

Accountability Visualization: Highlights the roles of AI and human operators in decision-making.

User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive UI with a Tetris-inspired design for visualizing navigation challenges.

How It Works

Data Input: The system receives data on flight paths, weather, and air traffic conditions.

AI Processing: Using advanced algorithms, the AI analyzes the data to determine optimal solutions.

Recommendations: AI presents its suggestions through the user interface.

Human Oversight: Operators evaluate and select the appropriate decision based on AIâ€™s recommendations.
